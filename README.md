With the development of the Internet, cyber-attacks are changing rapidly and the cyber security
situation is not optimistic. Hence we need advanced techniques and algorithms to prevent and detect them.
We are creating different models to predict malicious URL through ML/DL different approaches like Classification(Logistic Regression algo) 
Then we will choose model with best accuracy to predict 
Dataset source- Kaggle (Credits to Faizann)
Dataset consists of 4.2Lacs of URLs out of which 80% percent are good URLs and 20% are Bad URLs
